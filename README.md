Project Overview 

Client: The Gaming Room

The Gaming Room sought the development of a cross-platform game that could be played by multiple users simultaneously. They required a scalable, efficient software solution that could support the growth and expansion of their game, while ensuring a consistent experience across different platforms.

Reflection on the Design Process

What I Did Well:
In developing the software design documentation, I excelled at breaking down complex requirements into clear, actionable components. This made it easier to visualize how different parts of the system would interact and ensured that all the client’s needs were met.Helpful 

Aspects of the Design Document:
Working through the design document was particularly helpful in solidifying the structure and flow of the application before coding began. By mapping out the architecture, user interactions, and system components, I was able to foresee potential challenges and address them proactively in my design.

Areas for Improvement:
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would focus on the user interface design. While functional, I believe it could be enhanced with more user-centered design principles to improve the overall user experience. To improve this, I would incorporate more feedback loops with potential users during the design phase to refine the interface based on real user input.

Understanding User Needs:
Interpreting the user’s needs was central to my design approach. By prioritizing ease of use, scalability, and cross-platform consistency, I ensured that the end product would align with The Gaming Room’s goals. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the software is not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.

Design Approach:
My approach to designing software involved a thorough analysis of the requirements, followed by iterative design and review processes. In future projects, I would continue to use techniques such as user story mapping and prototyping to better understand and meet user expectations while also ensuring the technical feasibility of the design.
